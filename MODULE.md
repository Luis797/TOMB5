## What is a module file?

A module file (.MOD) is generated by DEL2FAB.EXE via usage of the /c+ option. 
This file is an external module which is used by the PlayStation, swapped in and out of ram at runtime also known as overlays.

## .MOD File layout

```C
struct MOD
{
    unsigned int* pRel;//Pointer to rel file, pointer is relative to offset 0x8.
    unsigned int relSize;//Size of relocation info.
    .section header //Not always present, usually contains a function table.
    char* binData[]; //Overlay mips binary data.
    unsigned int* relData[];//Overlay relocation info.
};
```
## .BIN File layout (standard overlay)

```C
struct BIN
{
    .section header //Not always present, usually contains a function table.
    char* binData[]; //Overlay mips binary data.
};
```
