## Contributing

Pull requests which drastically alter the structure or architecture of the code will not be accepted. This is to maintain "sanity" whilst going back through code, comparing to the original MIPS disassembled output.

If you're able to program in C or C++ please feel free to contact me. I can assign you tasks to prevent collisions with my local code which is not pushed yet. I'm typically looking for pull requests which resolve bugs, finish existing decompiled methods, improve readability, introduce new decompiled methods and improve code documentation.

## Code Formatting
```C
int main()//10064(<), 10064(<) (F) (*) (D) (ND)
```
Methods are organised as follows:
- The address on the left is the address of the function in the PSX internal beta version.
- The address on the right is the address of the function in the PSX final version.
- The arrows "(<)" pointing to the address specify whether the code for this method belongs to that specific version
- Then follows some markers.

Markers are as follows:
- ** - This method when compiled, produces identical code to the original.
- F - This method is final, meaning it has been fully decompiled.
- D - This method has been debugged and is now functionally the same as the original.
- ND - This method has not been debugged and may not be functionally the same as the original.

        - Download [SDL2-devel-2.0.12-mingw.tar.gz](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.12-mingw.tar.gz) extract the contents to [project root]/EXTERNAL/ rename folder "SDL2-2.0.9" to "SDL2".
        - Download [glew-2.1.0-mingw.zip](http://www.grhmedia.com/glew/glew-2.1.0-mingw.zip) extract the contents to [project root]/EXTERNAL/ 
        - Generate CMake project files for CodeBlocks MinGW Makefiles, x86 ONLY! (x64 is currently unsupported so don't try it.)
    - Linux 
Note: On x64 distributions GCC must be configured to build 32-bit binaries.
Note: Some later versions of GCC are currently unsupported.
         - Open terminal and type in the following commands:
	 - sudo apt-get update -qq
	 - sudo apt-get install -y cmake
         - sudo apt-get install -y libegl1-mesa-dev

	 - It is recommended that all game assets are placed in ROOT/EMSCRIPTEN/ASSETS/ otherwise the game will not be packaged with assets.
	 -Enter the command mingw32-make
	 
3. Windows PSX:
    - Download PSX PsyQ SDK 4.6 or 4.6 + 4.7 update, extract to c:/psyq
    - Download and install TDM-GCC.
    - Run psxdev's pspath.reg file to update registry environment variables.
    - Compile all the TOOLS in the tool folder of the solution.
	- Create a /DATA/ folder in BUILD\TOOLS\GAMEWAD_Unpack\Release
	- Extract GAMEWAD.OBJ using GAMEWAD_Unpack tool (drag and drop onto GAMEWAD_Unpack.exe).
	- Copy the /DATA/ FOLDER to BUILD\TOOLS\GAMEWAD_Pack\Release

4. Windows PC_N:
    - Install the DirectX 7 SDK ([link](https://mega.nz/#!nFgAhQpS!RIM-lDf7-3bedzYGFxYZHxsRGqg1ybKvTYka_kpFP4A)) to a simple path, such as `C:\dx7sdk`
    - Open project settings, in VC++ directories change the following:
      - Include dirs: add `C:\dx7sdk\Include` and then `$(WindowsSDK_IncludePath)` (make sure that one is **above** the DX one, otherwise you'll get compile errors)
      - Lib dirs: add `C:\dx7sdk\lib\x86`
      
## Game files setup

1. PSXPC_N
	By default CMake is configured to define the following pre-processor macros for compilation:
	- DEBUG_VERSION=0
	- PSX_VERSION=1
	- DISC_VERSION=0
	- BETA_VERSION=0
	- NTSC_VERSION=1
	- PSXPC_TEST=1
	- RELOC=0
	- USE_32_BIT_ADDR=1
	
	1.1 If you wish to use an ISO (.BIN/.CUE) file with the emulator it must be named to TOMB5.BIN/TOMB5.CUE with DISC_VERSION set to 1 (`DISC_VERSION=1`).
	
	1.2 If you wish to use the raw level assets (extracted out of the ISO) you must compile and use GAMEWAD_Unpack from the `/TOOLS/` folder to unpack GAMEWAD.OBJ and place the 		level files in a folder named /DATA/ at the root of where the MAIN binary is located.
